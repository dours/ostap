(** Implementation of streams as objects. *)

(** {2 General description} *)

(** This module provides a sample pattern for implementation of streams as objects.
    A stream is represented by a number of methods each of which tries to
    consume a certain lexeme from the stream. Thought [Ostap] is generally
    invariant with regard to stream implementation this approach helps to abstract
    parsers from lexers. The main use case for the implementation is to
    provide lexers for parser functions created via [Pa_ostap] syntax extensions,
    but you may use it on your own.
 
    The pattern given below is in turn just a sample --- it implements some
    simplest way to produce lexers using [Str] standard library; additionally
    it predefines types for error signaling and token representation. You must
    not generally use these types since you may implement objective lexer
    in any way you want. For example, you may write a grammar expression, say

    [let p = ostap (IDENT "(" IDENT (-"," IDENT)* ")")]
 
    inspect its type 

    {[
     (< getIDENT : ('a, 'b, 'c) Combinators.result;           
        look     : string -> ('a, 'd, 'c) Combinators.result; 
        ..                                                    
      > as 'a) ->                                             
     ('a, 'b * 'd * 'b * 'b list * 'd, 'c) Combinators.result 
    ]}

    and conclude that you need a stream of type

    {[
     < getIDENT : ('a, 'b, 'c) Combinators.result;           
       look     : string -> ('a, 'd, 'c) Combinators.result; 
       ..                                                    
     > as 'a                                                 
    }]

    Here ['a] is the type of stream itself, ['b] --- the type of data, returned by successful
    application of [getIDENT], ['c] --- the type of data returned by error/failure, ['d] ---
    the type of data, returned by successful application of [look]. [look] is just a member
    function to match a string against the stream.

    You may easily provide an appropriate stream implementation by inheriting class [matcher]. 
    The detailed description is given in the following section; for now we provide a simple example 
    for the last grammar expression:

    {[
     open Matcher 
	
     class lexer s = v}
         let ident = Str.regexp "[a-zA-Z_]\([a-zA-Z_0-9]\)*"] in 
         let skip  = Skip.create [Skip.whitespaces " \t\n\r"] in 
         object (self) 
            inherit Matcher.t s 
            method skip p coord = skip s p coord 
            method getIDENT = self#get "identifier" ident 
         end 
    ]}
       
    Lexer is an immutable object sprang over the string [s] to parse. Additionally it
    maintains the position within the string and its coordinate. Each time the lexeme is consumed
    from the stream the position and coordinates are shifted and a fresh instance
    of lexer is returned as the residual stream.

    To turn [matcher] into lexer you may need to define the following methods:

    {ul
       {- method [skip] to skip meaningless symbols (whitespaces, comments etc.) from 
        the stream; in the default case it does not skip anything.}
       {- method [getL] for any lexeme [L] to recognize. You may do this simply by
        calling method [get] from the base class and passing to it string name of the
        lexeme (for diagnostic purposes) and regular pattern of type [Str.regexp].
       } 
    }    

    [matcher] refers to three predefined types: [Msg.t], [Token.t], [Msg.Coord.t]. If you are
    not satisfied with them please consider implementing your own matcher.
